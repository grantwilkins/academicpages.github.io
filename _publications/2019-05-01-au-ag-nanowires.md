With the prevalence of shrinking devices and the recent study by Thapa and Pandey concerning the synthesis of Au-Ag Nanostructures that exhibit superconductivity, a computational study about Au-Ag wires was needed. While their methods included lab synthesis, this study works to manufacture a similar study in a computational simulation. In this study, SIESTA and TranSIESTA were used to synthesize temperature-independent results from a gold and silver wire using the principles of quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics. By varying an applied magnetic field, different current and voltage results were developed for the discrete cases. While complete replication of the Thapa and Pandey study was not possible in the computational setting due to temperature independence, the results revealed a lack of interesting conductive patterns and showed that the configuration tested has very little use in terms of device fabrication.
