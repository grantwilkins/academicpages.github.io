Molecular electronics will soon be pervasive in the world of technology. To properly understand the divergence from classical concepts, studies must be conducted to further understand the nature of simple systems at the quantum level. In this exploration, electrodes of differing composition in one atom thick terminals were tested against certain scattering regions to determine device behavior. Through this analysis, new device behavior and understanding was found in the I-V characteristics of Li, Be, and Na electrodes using computational modeling systems such as SIESTA, tranSIESTA, and NWChem. With the Li and Na electrodes acting similarly to transistors and the Be electrodes having a recurring diode-like behavior, new behaviors that should be further studied have been discovered.
